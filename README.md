## Structure of the VentanaIoT Organization
In the "VentanaIoT" GitHub organization that this repository exists in, there are two other important repositories to the Team 13 Project. The "Ventana" repository contains the code that runs the Ventana HoloLens application. The README file in the Ventana repo also contains the User's Manual, which is an extensive markdown document with information about the installation, use and development of the entire project. The "HoloHub" repository contains all the code for the server.
